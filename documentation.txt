**Impact of Player Position on Injuries with Logistic Regression**

We used Logistic Regression because it directly models the probability of a binary outcome (injury vs no injury),
it gives coefficients that show how position, age, and past injuries change the risk of injury and
it stays reliable on datasets of moderate size as long as each record is independent and the features aren’t too similar.
We did not use Random Forest or XGBoost because the position–risk link is mostly linear,
they can overfit and the results are harder to understand.

**Impact of Weather on Injuries with Random Forest**

We used a Random Forest classifier because it automatically detects non-linear patterns and interactions, 
it handles mixed and categorical inputs, 
it resists overfitting and it ranks feature importance so we know which weather factors drive injury risk. 
We did not use logistic regression because it assumes a smooth, linear effect and can’t capture sudden weather thresholds or the way different conditions interact.

**Weather and Schedule Effects on Attendance with Linear Regression**

We used Linear Regression because our attendance count is continuous, 
each coefficient gives a clear insight, it’s easy to check standard assumptions and it relies on pre-match data. 
We did not use Random Forest because it makes it hard to see how much each factor contributes to the final prediction.
